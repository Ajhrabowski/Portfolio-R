        My name is Anthony Hrabbowski. I am currently a student attending a MSU coding bootcamp. I have had many talents in my career. Once referred to myself as "One Man Many Talents." I am a Barber, Dj and a Personal Trainer. I once was a Recording Engineer and dabbled in the field of Graphic design for a minute. The Grapic Design is what landed me here.
        I became facinated with the Worldwide Web and how it looks. So I said to myself, I want to design a website.

          At that time I strived to start with Wix and didn't quite like it that much. Afterwards I decided to try the UX Design route instead. I liked it a little, however I wanted to get more in depth with designing and building of the site, more so than all the case studying and interviewing. So I decided to attend Henry Ford Community College
          to start my journey as a Web Developer.

        I completed one semester at Henry Community Ford and became so enthused and eager to get things moving, so I decided to attend MSU's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp, through edX's Online Learning Platform. So here I am Anthony John Hrabowski, Student of the Art of Web Development attending MSU Coding Bootcamp.
