        My name is Anthony Hrabbowski. I am currently a student attending a MSU coding bootcamp. I have had many talents in my career. Once refered to myself as "One Man Many Talents". I am a Barber, Dj and a Personal Trainer. I once was a Recording Engineer and dabled in the field of Graphic design for a minute. The Grapic Design is what landed me here.
        I became facinated with the Worldwide Web and how it looks. So I said to myself I want to design a website.

          I started with Wix and didn't quite like it that much. Decided to try the UX Design route. I liked it a little, However wanted to get more indepth with design and building more so than than with all the case studying and interviewing. So I decided to attended Henry Ford Community College
          to start my journey as a Web Developer.
